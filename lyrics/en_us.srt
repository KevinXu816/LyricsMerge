1
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,124
When I was lying there in the VA hospital,

2
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,127
with a big hole blown through the middle of my life,

3
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,422
I started having these dreams of flying.

4
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,258
I was free.

5
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,057
Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up.

6
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,778
They can fix a spinal, if you got the money,

7
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,725
but not on vet benefits,

8
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:13,614
not in this economy.

9
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,922
A VA check and 12 bucks

10
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:17,826
will get you a cup of coffee.

11
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,662
I'm what they call... waitlisted.

12
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,515
The Bengal Tiger,

13
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:34,218
extinct for over a century is making a comeback.

14
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,355
These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo

15
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:38,555
are the latest of a number of species

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,476
that have been cloned back into existence in the past five years.

17
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,773
I became a marine for the hardship. To be hammered on the anvil of life.

18
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,486
I told myself I can pass any test a man can pass.

19
00:01:55,365 --> 00:02:00,828
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

20
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,667
Let's get it straight, upfront.

21
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,168
I don't want your pity.

22
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,422
You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong planet.

23
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,846
The strong prey on the weak.

24
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,265
That's just the way things are.

25
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,643
And nobody does a damn thing.

26
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,163
Get off! Get off of him!

27
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:49,418
All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for.

28
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,222
I hope you realized

29
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:06,602
you just lost yourself a customer.

30
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,355
Candy-ass bitch.

31
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,735
If it ain't raining, we ain't training.

32
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,792
- It doesn't look like him.  - It's him.

33
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,128
You Jake Sully?

34
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,464
Step off. You're ruining my good mood.

35
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,507
It's about your brother.

36
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,767
We're looking for Sully, T.

37
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,770
In there.

38
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,462
Jesus, Tommy.

39
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,673
The strong prey on the weak.

40
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,926
A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be

41
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,595
for the paper in his wallet.

42
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,766
The concern of the suits was touching.

43
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,353
Your brother represented a significant investment.

44
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,897
We'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract.

45
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,135
And since your genome is identical to his,

46
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:38,443
you could step into his shoes,

47
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,029
so to speak.

48
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,681
It'd be a fresh start

49
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:44,741
on a new world.

50
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,704
You could do something important. You can make a difference.

51
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,877
And the pay is good.

52
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,504
Very good.

53
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,632
Tommy was the scientist, not me.

54
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,719
He was the one who wanted to get shot light-years out in space

55
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,095
to find the answers.

56
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,497
Me, I was just another dumb grunt

57
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:13,895
getting sent someplace he was gonna regret.

58
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,846
In cryo, you don't dream at all.

59
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,058
It doesn't feel like six years.

60
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,436
More like a fifth of tequila and an ass-kicking.

61
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,117
Are we there yet?

62
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,453
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

63
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,372
We're there.

64
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,749
You've been in cryo

65
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,626
for five years, nine months and 22 days.

66
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,504
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

67
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:25,675
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your convenience.

68
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,970
The staff thanks you in advance.

69
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,653
Up ahead was Pandora.

70
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,991
You grew up hearing about it, but I never figured I'd be going there.

71
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,763
Valkyrie 1-6, copy...

72
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,544
Valkyrie 1-6,

73
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:15,600
you are clear for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

74
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:20,188
Copy, Venture Star. Go for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

75
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,669
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!  - Exo-packs on! Let's go!

76
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,087
Remember, people, you lose that mask,

77
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,883
you're unconscious in 20 seconds, you're dead in four minutes!

78
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,744
Let's nobody be dead today!

79
00:07:49,745 --> 00:07:51,261
Looks very bad on my report.

80
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,724
Hell's Gate tower, this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

81
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,601
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

82
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,395
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

83
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,627
Put it together, let's go! Let's go!

84
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:45,941
Harnesses off! One minute!

85
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,507
When that ramp comes down,

86
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:49,986
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

87
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,614
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

88
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,060
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!

89
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:02,999
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

90
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,178
There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.

91
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,328
You may be out,

92
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:19,266
but you never lose the attitude.

93
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,821
Let's go, special case! Do not make me wait for you!

94
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,656
Well, well, ladies.

95
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,826
Look at all this fresh meat!

96
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,836
Back on Earth, these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

97
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,462
fighting for freedom.

98
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,679
Look out, hot rod!

99
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,016
But out here they're just hired guns,

100
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,977
taking the money, working for the company.

101
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,437
Check this out, man.

102
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,522
Meals on wheels.

103
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,735
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

104
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,695
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!

105
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,322
Got it! Need them!

106
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,875
You're not in Kansas anymore.

107
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:33,214
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

108
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,052
Respect that fact every second of every day.

109
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,930
If there is a hell,

110
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:46,311
you might want to go there for some R&R after a tour on Pandora.

111
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,314
Out there, beyond that fence,

112
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,940
every living thing that crawls,

113
00:10:51,941 --> 00:10:53,735
flies or squats in the mud

114
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,988
wants to kill you and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

115
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,504
We have an indigenous population of humanoids

116
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:03,703
called the Na'vi.

117
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,081
They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin

118
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,000
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

119
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:13,380
And they have bones reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

120
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,840
They are very hard to kill.

121
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,686
As head of security,

122
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:21,304
it is my job to keep you alive.

123
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,016
I will not succeed.

124
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,603
Not with all of you.

125
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,731
If you wish to survive,

126
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,692
you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude.

127
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,695
You've got to obey the rules.

128
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,490
Pandora rules.

129
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,451
Rule number one...

130
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,245
There's nothing like an old-school safety brief

131
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,996
to put your mind at ease.

132
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,584
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake! You're Jake,

133
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:54,879
right? Tom's brother.

134
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,799
Wow! You look just like him.

135
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,588
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.

136
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:01,636
I went through avatar training with him.

137
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,721
...into the bio-lab.

138
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,278
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.

139
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,977
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

140
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,311
- Hi. - Hey.

141
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,980
Link... Here's the link room right here.

142
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,357
This is where we're connecting to the avatar.

143
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,278
Me and Norm are here to drive

144
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,489
these remotely controlled bodies called avatars.

145
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,775
And they're grown from human DNA mixed

146
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,578
with the DNA of the natives.

147
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,621
- Hey. Welcome. - Hey.

148
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,262
Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.

149
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:31,082
 - Thanks.

150
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,961
Damn! They got big.

151
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,589
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.

152
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,008
So the proprioceptive sims seem to work really well.

153
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,968
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

154
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,970
It'll take us a few hours to get them decanted,

155
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,930
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

156
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,807
There's yours.

157
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,144
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

158
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,258
Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.

159
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:54,063
Good to meet you, yeah.

160
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,464
Looks like him.

161
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,550
No, it looks like you.

162
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,595
This is your avatar now, Jake.

163
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,470
And the concept is

164
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:33,228
that every driver is matched to his own avatar,

165
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,105
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

166
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,942
or something.

167
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,390
Which is why they offered me the gig,

168
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:44,697
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

169
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,617
which is insanely expensive.

170
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,522
Is this right?

171
00:13:49,523 --> 00:13:51,829
I just say whatever to the video log?

172
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,082
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit of documenting everything.

173
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,209
You know, what we see, what we feel.

174
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,698
It's all part of the science.

175
00:13:57,699 --> 00:13:59,003
And good science is good observation.

176
00:13:59,088 --> 00:13:59,790
Plus it'll help to

177
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,548
keep you sane for the next six years.

178
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,384
All right. Whatever.

179
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,012
So...

180
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,515
Well, here I am,

181
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,685
doing science.

182
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,437
They're coming out!

183
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,023
Attention. Drivers coming out of link.

184
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,699
Oh, God.

185
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,369
Where's the lab coat? Where's the lab coat?

186
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,270
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?

187
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:37,750
Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

188
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:39,874
Thank you!

189
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,297
Grace Augustine is a legend.

190
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,882
She's the head of the Avatar Program. She wrote the book,

191
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,760
I mean, literally wrote the book on Pandoran botany.

192
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,054
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants better than people.

193
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,432
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

194
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,239
Grace, I'd like you to meet

195
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,227
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

196
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,916
Norm. I hear good things about you.

197
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:01,691
How's your Na'vi?

198
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,986
May the All Mother...

199
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,196
...smile upon our first meeting.

200
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,408
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

201
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,870
I studied for five years...

202
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,955
...but there is much to learn.

203
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,999
Grace? This is Jake Sully.

204
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,667
Ma'am.

205
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,255
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are, and I don't need you. I need your brother.

206
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,371
You know, the PhD who trained

207
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:27,967
for three years for this mission?

208
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,469
He's dead.

209
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,513
I know it's a big inconvenience for everyone.

210
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,934
- How much lab training have you had? - I dissected a frog once.

211
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,522
You see? You see? I mean, they're just pissing on us

212
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,983
without even the courtesy of calling it rain.

213
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,318
- I'm going to Selfridge. - No, Grace,

214
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,148
I don't think that's a good idea.

215
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,945
No, man, this is such bullshit!

216
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,447
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

217
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,408
He has no business sticking his nose in my department.

218
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,246
Here tomorrow, 0800. Try and use big words.

219
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,142
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.

220
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:09,509
You are cleared for south departure.

221
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,387
Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.

222
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,477
- You see that? - Yes, sir.

223
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,646
No, you didn't. You were looking at the monitor.

224
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,587
I love this putter, Ronnie!

225
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:24,649
I love this putter.

226
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:31,823
Parker, you know, I used to think it was benign neglect,

227
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,867
but now I see that you're intentionally screwing me.

228
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,454
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

229
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,337
I need a researcher. Not some jarhead dropout.

230
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,005
Well, actually, I thought we got lucky with him.

231
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,674
- Lucky? - Yeah.

232
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,718
How is this in any way lucky?

233
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,553
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

234
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,556
and lucky that brother wasn't some oral hygienist or something.

235
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,558
A Marine we can use.

236
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,560
I'm assigning him to your team as security escort.

237
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,945
The last thing I need is

238
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:04,021
another trigger-happy moron out there!

239
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,065
Look, look, you're supposed to be winning the hearts

240
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,191
and the minds of the natives.

241
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:07,638
Isn't that the whole point

242
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,068
of your little puppet show?

243
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,695
If you look like them and you talk like them,

244
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,405
then they'll start trusting us.

245
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,532
We build them a school, we teach them English,

246
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,576
but after, what, how many years?

247
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,244
Relations with the indigenous are only getting worse.

248
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,581
Yeah, that tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.

249
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,708
Right. Come here.

250
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,544
I can't... I can't...

251
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,759
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

252
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,586
Because this little gray rock sells

253
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,928
for 20 million a kilo.

254
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,201
That's the only reason.

255
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:39,223
It's what pays for the whole party.

256
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,225
It's what pays for your science.

257
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,772
Now, those savages are threatening our whole operation,

258
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,106
we're on the brink of war,

259
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,155
and you're supposed to be

260
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:50,401
finding a diplomatic solution.

261
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,946
So use what you've got, and get me some results.

262
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,418
So, how much link time have you logged?

263
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,130
- About 520 hours. - That's good.

264
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,415
You're in there. You're here.

265
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,510
How much have you logged?

266
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,262
Zip. But I read a manual.

267
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,265
Tell me you're joking.

268
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,976
This is cool.

269
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,853
Let's go.

270
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,484
Don't. I got this.

271
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,491
So you just figured you'd come out here,

272
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,118
to the most hostile environment known to man,

273
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,956
with no training of any kind, and see how it went?

274
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,375
What was going through your head?

275
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,294
Maybe I was sick of doctors telling me what I couldn't do.

276
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,526
Biometrics are good.

277
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:53,673
Link three is ready.

278
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:58,427
Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.

279
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,307
Down. Just relax and let your mind go blank.

280
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,977
That shouldn't be hard for you.

281
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,812
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...

282
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,355
Initiate link.

283
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:12,692
Run sequence unit three. Go.

284
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,151
Launching.

285
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,075
I have the first congruency.

286
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:35,047
- That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity. - Go figure.

287
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,049
Phase-Iock 40%.

288
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,597
All right. Going in.

289
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,807
I'm going in in four.

290
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,479
Phase-Iock 99%. Link is stable.

291
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:09,214
He's in. Jake, can you hear me?

292
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:11,250
Can you hear me, Jake?

293
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,877
Pupillary reflex is good.

294
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,674
Pinna response normal. How you feeling, Jake?

295
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,760
Hey, guys.

296
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,429
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

297
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,889
Good!

298
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,390
Yeah, we're gonna take this nice and easy, Jake.

299
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,601
- And touch your thumb to your fingers. - Yeah.

300
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,061
- Thumb to your fingers. - No problem.

301
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,729
That's good. I can see you can remember that one.

302
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,981
- Got it. - Well, if you want to sit up,

303
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,399
- that's fine. - Okay, good. Just take it

304
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,402
nice and slow, Jake. Good. Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

305
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,989
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all? You're wiggling your toes!

306
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,824
- Good. Good, Jake. - That's great.

307
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,412
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

308
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,165
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

309
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,793
That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.

310
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,128
Take it easy. Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

311
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,798
There's a few more sensory motor reflex tests we need to run,

312
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,967
- so take it easy. - Wait.

313
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,468
- Jake. - Sit down, Jake.

314
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,929
Jake! Listen to me. Jake!

315
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,264
- I need you to sit down. Jake! - It's okay.

316
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,141
- Buddy, listen to me. - It's all good. I got this.

317
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,366
Jake, you need to sit down right now.

318
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:12,937
Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

319
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,515
Listen to me. For your own safety,

320
00:21:14,516 --> 00:21:15,147
you need to sit down.

321
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:17,984
You need time to adjust to the avatar... Whoa! Jake!

322
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,319
- God, Jake, watch your tail. - Yeah!

323
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:24,490
Sedate! Sedate him! A thousand milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

324
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,867
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

325
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,952
By the numbers.

326
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,453
- Jake. Come on. - Jake! Listen to me.

327
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,122
You're not used to your avatar body.

328
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,957
- This is dangerous. - This is great.

329
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,006
Jake? Jake, listen to me.

330
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:36,252
Come on. They're gonna put you out.

331
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,901
Norm, sit down.

332
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:41,465
No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

333
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,134
God damn it! Bring them home!

334
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,886
- Norm! Do not leave control! - You're not ready for it!

335
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,379
Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.

336
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,475
So close!

337
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,144
I don't even have to play defense on it.

338
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,729
Hey, guys. Hey.

339
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,196
It's okay, I'll get him.

340
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:57,148
Jake, you have to come back!

341
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,983
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

342
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,154
- Watch it! - Sorry!

343
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,655
Come on!

344
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,659
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

345
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,588
- Jeez! Sorry. - Watch it!

346
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,361
Hey, Marine!

347
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,614
Damn.

348
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,898
Grace?

349
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:51,827
Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

350
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,580
Think fast.

351
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,583
Motor control's looking good.

352
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:11,806
Come on, everybody, quiet down! All right, gang, lights out.

353
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,058
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

354
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,559
Hey, hey, hey!

355
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,270
Don't play with that, you'll go blind.

356
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,897
That's kind of freaky.

357
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,399
Come on. Scat.

358
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,735
Good night.

359
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,573
Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.

360
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,640
Welcome back.

361
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,942
- You okay? You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay.

362
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,404
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.

363
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:11,949
And this here is my baby.

364
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,160
Hold on a second.

365
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,621
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

366
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,193
We bounce at zero-nine.

367
00:24:20,194 --> 00:24:22,168
Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

368
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,837
Vine strike's still loose.

369
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,173
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

370
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,549
Watch it!

371
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,844
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not the only thing flying around out there.

372
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,679
Or the biggest.

373
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,515
I'm gonna need you on a door gun. I'm a man short.

374
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,434
I thought you'd never ask.

375
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,938
There's your man. See you on the flight line.

376
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,035
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

377
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,746
This low gravity'll make you soft.

378
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,707
You get soft,

379
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:08,255
Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning.

380
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,884
I pulled your record, Corporal.

381
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,386
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

382
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,682
Nothing like this here, though.

383
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,355
You got some heart, kid, showing up in this neighborhood.

384
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,273
I figured it's just another hellhole.

385
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,776
I was First Recon myself.

386
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,071
A few years ahead of you. Well, maybe more than a few.

387
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,950
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

388
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,493
I come out here?

389
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,505
Day one.

390
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:41,538
Think I felt like a shavetail louie?

391
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,125
Yeah. They could fix me up,

392
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,210
if I rotated back.

393
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,807
Yeah, and make me pretty again.

394
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:51,966
But you know what? I kind of like it.

395
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,885
It reminds me every day what's waiting out there.

396
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,342
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.

397
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:02,810
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

398
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:09,900
However, it does present an opportunity both timely and unique.

399
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,568
- Clear! - Clear!

400
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:20,058
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.

401
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:21,954
That's a potent mix.

402
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,622
Give me the goose bumps.

403
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:27,126
Such a Marine could provide the intel I need,

404
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,919
right on the ground.

405
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,131
Right in the hostiles' camp.

406
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:38,262
Look, Sully. I want you to learn these savages from the inside.

407
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,097
I want you to gain their trust.

408
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,932
I need to know how to force their cooperation

409
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,476
or hammer them hard if they won't.

410
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,847
Am I still with Augustine?

411
00:26:47,848 --> 00:26:48,272
On paper.

412
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,744
Yeah, you walk like one of her science pukes,

413
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:52,443
you quack like one,

414
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,529
but you report to me.

415
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,741
Can you do that for me, son?

416
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,660
Hell, yeah, sir.

417
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,371
Well, all right, then.

418
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,344
Son, I take care of my own.

419
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,470
You get me what I need,

420
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,806
I'll see to it you get your legs back when you rotate home.

421
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,184
Your real legs.

422
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,980
That sounds real good, sir.

423
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,323
- Link's ready! - Phase-Iock 40%.

424
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,035
Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.

425
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,663
I have five congruencies. Phase-Iock 90%.

426
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,082
Link three ready.

427
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,417
All right, I'm going in.

428
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,576
Sturmbeest herd coming up on your right.

429
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,453
Got it! Thanks.

430
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:31,041
Looks like a bull, a dozen cows and some juveniles.

431
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,508
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

432
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,765
- Norm! Your pack. - Pack.

433
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,109
Stay with the ship.

434
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,397
One idiot with a gun is enough.

435
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,485
You the man, Doc.

436
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,191
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

437
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,239
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

438
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,413
So, how will they know we're here?

439
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,166
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

440
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,256
This was our school.

441
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,592
Now it's just... storage.

442
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,345
The kids were so bright.

443
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,264
Eager to learn.

444
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,849
They picked up English faster than I could teach it.

445
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,271
So, we'll take a couple of these Ph monitors...

446
00:30:57,563 --> 00:30:59,481
...and a soil probe.

447
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:05,028
That little yellow case back there. The old microscope.

448
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,155
Here.

449
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,824
Oh, yeah. I love this one.

450
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,034
The stingbats knocked them down.

451
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,337
I keep hoping someone will come back in and read them.

452
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,131
Why don't they come back?

453
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,136
The Omaticaya...

454
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,222
learned as much about us as they needed to.

455
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,562
What happened here?

456
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,446
Are you going to help us with this gear?

457
00:31:44,447 --> 00:31:45,527
We've got a lot to do.

458
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,085
- Keep moving, Norm. - Keep up, guys!

459
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:08,091
- And here I go. - Scanning.

460
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,680
Wow! It's that fast?

461
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:18,018
- Amazing, isn't it? - Yeah.

462
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,897
So, that is signal transduction from this root

463
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:24,157
to the root of the tree next to it. So,

464
00:32:24,158 --> 00:32:25,609
we should take a sample.

465
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,361
Okay. Sample.

466
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:33,700
You know, it's probably electrical, based on the speed of the reaction.

467
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,330
Norm, you've contaminated the sample with your saliva.

468
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,582
Right.

469
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,237
So, here I go.

470
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:39,558
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

471
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,896
It's already pissed off.

472
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,024
Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.

473
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,750
It's a territorial threat display.

474
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:57,951
Do not run, or he'll charge.

475
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,370
So, what do I do, dance with it?

476
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,915
Just hold your ground.

477
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,391
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

478
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,478
Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

479
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,898
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

480
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,027
That's right, get your punk ass back to mommy.

481
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:35,030
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing. You keep running.

482
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,116
Yeah, and why don't you bring back some of your friends, huh?

483
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,329
Oh, shit.

484
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,635
So what about this one? Run? Don't run? What?

485
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,096
Run! Definitely run!

486
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,866
I'm gonna have to call it, guys.

487
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,869
We're not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's orders.

488
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,915
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to hang on till morning.

489
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,542
He won't make it till morning.

490
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:52,407
I don't have all goddamn night.

491
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,326
Come on! Come on!

492
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,902
Hey, wait. Don't!

493
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,531
Great.

494
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,551
Look, I know you probably don't understand this,

495
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,891
but thank you.

496
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,481
Thank you.

497
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,945
That was pretty impressive.

498
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,617
I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along. It was...

499
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:48,291
Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?

500
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,752
Wait up!

501
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,337
Just... Hey, slow down.

502
00:43:53,338 --> 00:43:56,424
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say thanks for killing those things.

503
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,553
- Damn! - Don't thank.

504
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,848
You don't thank for this.

505
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:09,353
This is sad. Very sad only.

506
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,356
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

507
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,026
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

508
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,699
All this is your fault. They did not need to die.

509
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,785
My fault? They attacked me.

510
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,619
How am I the bad guy?

511
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,370
Your fault!

512
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,540
- Your fault! - Easy. Easy.

513
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,377
You're like a baby. Making noise, don't know what to do.

514
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:34,879
Easy.

515
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,550
Fine. Fine.

516
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,845
If you love your little forest friends,

517
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:46,224
why not let them just kill my ass?

518
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,018
What's the thinking?

519
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,225
Why save you?

520
00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:52,522
Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

521
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,903
You have a strong heart.

522
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,240
No fear.

523
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,622
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

524
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,464
Well, if I'm like a child, then...

525
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,342
Look, maybe you should teach me.

526
00:45:21,426 --> 00:45:23,636
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

527
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,638
Well, then teach me how to See.

528
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,182
- No one can teach you to See. - Whoa.

529
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,936
Look, come on, can't we talk?

530
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,377
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?

531
00:45:35,378 --> 00:45:36,774
Dr. Augustine's school?

532
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:42,446
You're like a baby.

533
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:43,322
You're like a baby.

534
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,122
I need your help.

535
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,083
You should not be here.

536
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,727
Okay, take me with you.

537
00:45:56,728 --> 00:45:57,837
No! Go back.

538
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:01,549
No.

539
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,302
Go back.

540
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:26,949
No!

541
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,931
What...

542
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,186
What are they?

543
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:58,522
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

544
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,234
Very pure spirits.

545
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,301
What was that all about?

546
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,513
Come.

547
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,057
Come!

548
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,560
Where are we going?

549
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,155
Come.

550
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,047
What's your name?

551
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,215
Shit!

552
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,825
Okay.

553
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:38,414
Calm people, calm.

554
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,006
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

555
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,386
These demons are forbidden here.

556
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,514
There has been a sign.

557
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,850
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

558
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:03,689
Bring him.

559
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,776
What's going on?

560
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,237
Wait.

561
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,825
What's happening?

562
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:16,702
Hey!

563
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,232
Father...

564
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,860
...I see you.

565
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,998
This creature...

566
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,376
...why do you bring him here?

567
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,212
I was going to kill him...

568
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,339
...but there was a sign from Eywa.

569
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:54,592
I have said...

570
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,261
...no dreamwalker will come here.

571
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,679
What's he saying?

572
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,515
His alien smell fills my nose.

573
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,683
Hey, what's he saying?

574
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,935
My father is deciding whether to kill you.

575
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,523
Your father. It's nice to meet you, sir.

576
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,695
Step back!

577
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:20,242
I will look at this alien.

578
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,660
That is Mother.

579
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:25,664
She is Tsahik. The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

580
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,875
Who's Eywa?

581
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,467
What are you called?

582
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,761
Jake Sully.

583
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,417
Why did you come to us?

584
00:51:50,418 --> 00:51:51,482
I came to learn.

585
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,819
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

586
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,240
It is hard to fill a cup which is already full.

587
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,077
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

588
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,864
Just ask Dr. Augustine.

589
00:52:05,865 --> 00:52:06,956
I'm no scientist.

590
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,499
What are you?

591
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,963
I was a Marine. A...

592
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:17,466
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

593
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,260
A warrior!

594
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,844
I could kill him easily!

595
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:22,137
I could kill him easily! No!

596
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:26,767
This is the first warrior dreamwalker...

597
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,727
...we have seen.

598
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,605
We need to learn more about him.

599
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,985
My Daughter...

600
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,364
...you will teach him our way...

601
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:43,826
...to speak and walk as we do.

602
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,454
Why me? That's not fair...

603
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,820
It is decided.

604
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:52,376
My daughter will teach you our ways.

605
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,046
Learn well, Jakesully.

606
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,634
Then we will see if your insanity can be cured.

607
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,821
Good evening.

608
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,659
Please don't get up.

609
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:28,829
Excuse me.

610
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,333
Sorry.

611
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,129
Hey, how you doing?

612
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,722
Thank you.

613
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,602
You know, I don't even know your name.

614
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,730
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite

615
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,942
Again, a whole lot slower?

616
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,277
Neytiri.

617
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,987
Neytili.

618
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,281
Neytiri.

619
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,658
Neytiri.

620
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,661
It's nice to meet you, Neytiri.

621
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,538
It's nice.

622
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,667
- Jake. Jake! - He's in alpha.

623
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,795
- He's coming out right now. - Jake. Jake!

624
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,675
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

625
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,012
There you go. There you go, there you go.

626
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:11,473
You're okay. You're okay.

627
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,476
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

628
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,107
- Is the avatar safe? - Yeah, Doc.

629
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,944
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

630
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,948
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass

631
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:29,255
disappearing into the brush

632
00:55:29,256 --> 00:55:32,161
with this angry thanator coming after him.

633
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,164
- Hey, it's not something you can teach. - That is awesome.

634
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,624
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

635
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,493
the Omaticaya have chosen you.

636
00:55:39,494 --> 00:55:40,961
God help us all.

637
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,797
"Jarhead clan"?

638
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,778
And it worked?

639
00:55:46,779 --> 00:55:48,427
Hey, I'm practically family.

640
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,730
They're gonna study me.

641
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:53,015
I have to learn to be one of them.

642
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,683
That's called taking the initiative, son.

643
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,209
I wish I had 10 more like you.

644
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:57,227
Look, Sully. Sully.

645
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,731
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

646
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,151
You know,

647
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:07,321
I mean, we try to give them medicine, education, roads.

648
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,156
But no, no, no, they like mud.

649
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:13,202
And that wouldn't bother me, it's just that they're...

650
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:16,830
Hey, can you... Can somebody just... Sector 12.

651
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:21,835
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop...

652
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,046
Rich, stop! That's... Jesus!

653
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:30,219
Their damn village happens to be resting on the richest unobtanium deposit

654
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,357
within 200 klicks in any direction.

655
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:35,599
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

656
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,855
- Well, who gets them to move? - Guess.

657
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,547
What if they won't go?

658
00:56:45,548 --> 00:56:47,319
I'm betting that they will.

659
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,531
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.

660
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,201
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

661
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:56,236
but there's one thing that shareholders hate

662
00:56:56,237 --> 00:56:58,038
more than bad press,

663
00:56:58,122 --> 00:56:59,980
and that's a bad quarterly statement.

664
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:01,375
I didn't make up the rules.

665
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:04,586
So just find me a carrot that'll get them to move,

666
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,219
otherwise

667
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,423
it's gonna have to be all stick. Okay?

668
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,775
You got three months.

669
00:57:10,776 --> 00:57:12,719
That's when the 'dozers get there.

670
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,805
Well, we're wasting time.

671
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,890
I like this guy.

672
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:20,561
- Guys, right now... - Okay, let's run through them again.

673
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,896
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

674
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,901
- Eytucan. - Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

675
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:31,154
But she's the spiritual leader. Like a shaman.

676
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,823
Got it.

677
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,117
- T'su'tey. - Tsu'tey.

678
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,911
- Tsu'tey. - He'll be the next clan leader.

679
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:42,416
- Neytiri. - She'll be the next Tsahik.

680
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,501
They become a mated pair.

681
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,754
- So who's this Eywa? - Who's Eywa?

682
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:52,259
Only their deity. Their goddess, made up of all living things.

683
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,719
Everything they know!

684
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,887
You'd know this if you had any training whatsoever.

685
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,347
Who's got a date with the chief's daughter?

686
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,099
Come on. That's...

687
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,768
Knock it off. It's like kindergarten around here.

688
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,815
Neytiri was my best student.

689
00:58:06,899 --> 00:58:09,901
She and her sister, Sylwanin.

690
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,404
Just amazing girls.

691
00:58:12,488 --> 00:58:14,072
I got a date with Sylwanin too.

692
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,033
She's dead.

693
00:58:19,912 --> 00:58:22,456
Let's go. Village life starts early.

694
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:27,169
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

695
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,689
Easy, boy.

696
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,400
Pale is female.

697
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,781
Okay. Easy, girl.

698
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,313
That is shahaylu. The bond.

699
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,733
Feel her.

700
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:38,990
Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.

701
00:59:41,994 --> 00:59:43,787
Feel her strong legs.

702
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,583
You may tell her what to do.

703
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,876
Inside.

704
00:59:50,837 --> 00:59:53,755
For now, say where to go.

705
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,009
Forward!

706
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:17,174
You should go away.

707
01:00:17,175 --> 01:00:18,738
No, you'd miss me.

708
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,451
I knew you could speak English.

709
01:00:25,037 --> 01:00:27,205
This alien will learn nothing...

710
01:00:27,623 --> 01:00:29,249
...a rock sees more...

711
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,501
...look at him.

712
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:41,845
Again.

713
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,264
If you want to hit this thing,

714
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,432
it's gonna be complicated.

715
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,934
Your scan doesn't show the internal structure.

716
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,145
There's an outer row of columns.

717
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,981
Real heavy duty. There's a secondary ring here,

718
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,364
and an inner ring.

719
01:00:54,365 --> 01:00:56,610
There's a core structure like a spiral.

720
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,112
That's how they move up and down.

721
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:02,115
We're gonna need accurate scans on every column.

722
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:03,492
Roger that.

723
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,286
What else can you tell us about the structure?

724
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:09,122
I'm guessing this secondary ring, that's also load-bearing.

725
01:01:13,669 --> 01:01:17,130
- So where are we going? - Getting out of Dodge.

726
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:22,677
I'm not about to let Selfridge and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

727
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:26,014
There's a mobile link up at Site 26 we can work out of,

728
01:01:26,098 --> 01:01:28,058
way up in the mountains.

729
01:01:28,809 --> 01:01:31,186
The Hallelujah Mountains?

730
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,480
- That's right. - Are you serious?

731
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,524
- Yeah. - Yes!

732
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:41,371
The legendary floating mountains of Pandora.

733
01:01:41,372 --> 01:01:42,656
Heard of them?

734
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,046
We're getting close.

735
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:00,840
Yeah, look at my instruments.

736
01:02:00,841 --> 01:02:03,885
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

737
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,221
We're VFR from here on.

738
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,181
What's VFR?

739
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:10,559
Means you gotta see where you're going.

740
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,781
You can't see anything.

741
01:02:12,782 --> 01:02:14,563
Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

742
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,709
Oh, my God.

743
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,096
You should see your faces.

744
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,542
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

745
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,266
So what does hold them up?

746
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,809
Grace explained it to me.

747
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,479
Some kind of maglev effect.

748
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:41,399
Because unobtanium is a superconductor... or something.

749
01:04:03,964 --> 01:04:05,548
Welcome to camp.

750
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:14,057
- So, this is my bunk. - This stuff is nasty.

751
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,394
- Norm, go under. - All right.

752
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:19,411
Grace didn't miss a thing.

753
01:04:19,412 --> 01:04:21,022
Trudy, you'll take the top one.

754
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,525
She knew I was talking to the Colonel.

755
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:27,237
But I had what she needed, a way back in with the clan,

756
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,863
so she's playing nice.

757
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,491
All right. Jake, hang a left.

758
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:34,035
You'll be in the link at the end.

759
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:41,000
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

760
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:31,551
Holy shit!

761
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,345
Do not look in her eye.

762
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,606
Ikran is not horse.

763
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,609
Once shahaylu is made,

764
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:55,825
ikran will fly with only one hunter in the whole life.

765
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,505
To become taronyu, hunter,

766
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:10,871
you must choose your own ikran

767
01:06:10,872 --> 01:06:12,175
and he must choose you.

768
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,763
- When? - When you are ready.

769
01:07:07,147 --> 01:07:10,316
Okay. This is video log 12.

770
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,194
Time's 2132.

771
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:18,032
Do I have to do this now? I really need to get some rack.

772
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:20,910
No, now. When it's fresh.

773
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,415
Okay, location, shack,

774
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,710
and the days are starting to blur together.

775
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:34,090
The language is a pain, but, you know,

776
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:35,581
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.

777
01:07:35,582 --> 01:07:37,302
Just repetition, repetition.

778
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,053
- Navi.  - "Nari."

779
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:41,389
- Nari.  - "Narrri"!

780
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,682
Narrri!

781
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:53,902
Neytiri calls me skxawng. It means moron.

782
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,739
This is a very important part of it.

783
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,304
Norm's attitude has improved lately.

784
01:07:59,305 --> 01:07:59,949
I see you. I see you.

785
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:02,410
But it's not just, "I'm seeing you in front of me,"

786
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,078
it's "I see into you. I See you."

787
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,671
It's good he's back on board,

788
01:08:05,672 --> 01:08:06,831
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.

789
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,416
"I'm accepting you. I understand you."

790
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,167
So you gotta get this, okay?

791
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:12,462
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

792
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,304
My feet are getting tougher.

793
01:08:15,305 --> 01:08:16,841
I can run farther every day.

794
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,846
I have to trust my body to know what to do.

795
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,686
Yeah! Check it out!

796
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:30,772
Oh, crap!

797
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:38,307
Every day it's reading the trails,

798
01:08:38,308 --> 01:08:39,948
the tracks at the waterhole,

799
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,200
the tiniest scents and sounds.

800
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:52,543
She's always going on about the flow of energy, the spirits of animals.

801
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,843
I really hope this tree-hugger crap

802
01:08:54,844 --> 01:08:56,005
isn't on the final.

803
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:59,801
This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there, you know.

804
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,512
You need to listen to what she says.

805
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:05,807
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

806
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,434
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

807
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,411
With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.

808
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,831
You gotta be kidding me.

809
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,903
I talked Mo'at into letting Grace into the village.

810
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,656
Look how big you are.

811
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:04,657
It's the first time since her school was closed down.

812
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:06,492
You are so pretty.

813
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,315
Come on, Marine.

814
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:05,259
I'm trying to understand this deep connection

815
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:07,553
the people have to the forest.

816
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:10,848
She talks about a network of energy

817
01:11:11,683 --> 01:11:14,268
that flows through all living things.

818
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:18,481
She says all energy is only borrowed,

819
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,984
and one day you have to give it back.

820
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:05,528
You were in 16 hours today.

821
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,408
You're still losing weight.

822
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:16,581
No, you don't.

823
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:19,375
- I gotta get some sleep. - Come back here.

824
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:26,966
Today I made a kill.

825
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,061
And we ate it. At least,

826
01:12:29,062 --> 01:12:30,761
I know where that meal came from.

827
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:32,699
Other body.

828
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:35,266
You need to take care of this body. Okay?

829
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:37,059
- Get it? Let's eat it.  - Yeah, yeah.

830
01:12:37,644 --> 01:12:40,062
Here. I'll make it easy for you.

831
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,356
Give it to me.

832
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:43,941
- You look like crap.  - Thank you.

833
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,776
You're burning way too hard.

834
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,696
Get rid of this shit.

835
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,698
And then you can lecture me.

836
01:12:51,783 --> 01:12:54,493
Now, I'm telling you, as your boss,

837
01:12:55,954 --> 01:12:59,290
and as someone who might even consider being a friend someday

838
01:12:59,374 --> 01:13:01,792
to take some down time.

839
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,628
Eat this, please.

840
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:08,382
Trust me, I... learned the hard way.

841
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:25,566
What did happen at the school, Grace?

842
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:37,624
Neytiri's sister, Sylwanin,

843
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:39,372
stopped coming to school.

844
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:41,499
She was angry about the clear-cutting.

845
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:44,730
And one day,

846
01:13:44,731 --> 01:13:46,879
she and a couple of other young hunters came running in

847
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:50,091
all painted up.

848
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:52,802
They had set a bulldozer on fire.

849
01:13:56,139 --> 01:13:59,016
I guess they thought I could protect them.

850
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,647
The troopers pursued them to the school.

851
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:08,025
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.

852
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:10,403
Right in front of Neytiri.

853
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:11,654
And then shot the others.

854
01:14:14,449 --> 01:14:15,950
I got most of the kids out.

855
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,622
But they never came back.

856
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,460
I'm sorry.

857
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:38,848
A scientist stays objective.

858
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:43,561
We can't be ruled by emotion.

859
01:14:43,603 --> 01:14:46,814
But I put 10 years of my life into that school.

860
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,568
They called me sa'nok.

861
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:53,654
Mother.

862
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:54,739
Mother.

863
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:01,579
That kind of pain reaches back through the link.

864
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:28,147
I see you...

865
01:15:28,231 --> 01:15:29,440
...Brother

866
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,109
...and thank you.

867
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,115
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

868
01:15:38,658 --> 01:15:40,493
Your body stays behind...

869
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,454
...to become part of The People.

870
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:48,626
A clean kill.

871
01:15:51,963 --> 01:15:53,464
You are ready.

872
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:22,493
Learning to ride an ikran, we call them banshees,

873
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:25,162
is the test every young hunter has to pass.

874
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:28,708
But to do that,

875
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,709
you gotta go where the banshees are.

876
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:32,753
Oo-rah.

877
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:05,494
Now what?

878
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:55,562
Jakesully will go first.

879
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:32,433
Now you choose your ikran. This you must feel inside.

880
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:34,603
If he also chooses you,

881
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:36,312
move quick like I showed.

882
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:39,273
You will have one chance, Jake.

883
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,442
How will I know if he chooses me?

884
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:43,485
He will try to kill you.

885
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:46,071
Outstanding.

886
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:47,758
Let's dance.

887
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,766
That moron's going to die.

888
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,583
Don't be afraid, warrior.

889
01:21:21,584 --> 01:21:23,085
Make the bond!

890
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:27,423
No!

891
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:32,511
Jake!

892
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:48,152
Shahaylu, Jake.

893
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:51,780
Shahaylu!

894
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,000
Stop!

895
01:22:11,634 --> 01:22:16,722
Yeah, that's right. You're mine. Huh?

896
01:22:29,944 --> 01:22:32,905
First flight seals the bond. You cannot wait.

897
01:22:34,407 --> 01:22:36,575
- Think, "Fly!" - Fly?

898
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,460
God damn!

899
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:52,132
Oh, shit!

900
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:03,769
Shut up and fly straight!

901
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:16,365
That's it. Bank left!

902
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,459
Level out! That's it.

903
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,299
Jakesully!

904
01:23:59,075 --> 01:24:00,158
Hey!

905
01:24:06,165 --> 01:24:07,499
Let's go!

906
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:21,847
Yeah, baby, I got this!

907
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:23,932
Oh, shit!

908
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:31,181
I may not be much of a horse guy,

909
01:24:31,182 --> 01:24:32,983
but I was born to do this.

910
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:34,901
Yeah!

911
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:39,031
- I came like this. This you. - Yeah, yeah.

912
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:41,792
I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong.

913
01:24:41,793 --> 01:24:44,036
Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard...

914
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:48,100
The Tree of Souls.

915
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:53,730
It's their most sacred place.

916
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:57,317
See the Flux Vortex in these false color images?

917
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:59,486
Yeah, that's what messes up my instruments.

918
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:04,116
There is something really interesting going on in there biologically.

919
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:07,577
I would die to get samples.

920
01:26:08,162 --> 01:26:10,997
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

921
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:12,416
You lucky swine.

922
01:27:33,789 --> 01:27:34,873
Hell, yeah!

923
01:27:34,957 --> 01:27:36,500
Hell, yeah!

924
01:27:49,305 --> 01:27:53,016
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter. Death from above.

925
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:57,354
Only problem is, you're not the only one.

926
01:28:01,317 --> 01:28:02,400
Dive!

927
01:28:25,174 --> 01:28:26,383
Go, go!

928
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:35,892
Follow me!

929
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:24,941
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

930
01:29:25,818 --> 01:29:28,862
It is Toruk. Last Shadow.

931
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:33,742
Yeah, right. It's the last one you ever see.

932
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:42,125
My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk Macto.

933
01:29:42,793 --> 01:29:44,586
Rider of Last Shadow.

934
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:47,422
He rode this?

935
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,675
Toruk chose him.

936
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:53,142
It has only happened five times

937
01:29:53,143 --> 01:29:54,888
since the time of the First Songs.

938
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:56,973
- That's a long time. - Yes.

939
01:29:57,683 --> 01:29:59,559
Toruk Macto was mighty.

940
01:30:01,395 --> 01:30:05,231
He brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow.

941
01:30:05,232 --> 01:30:07,567
All Na'vi people know the story.

942
01:30:14,283 --> 01:30:16,641
Everything is backwards now.

943
01:30:16,642 --> 01:30:18,495
Like out there is the true world

944
01:30:19,622 --> 01:30:21,623
and in here is the dream.

945
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:45,021
It's hard to believe it's only been three months.

946
01:30:48,067 --> 01:30:50,527
I can barely remember my old life.

947
01:30:54,073 --> 01:30:55,907
I don't know who I am anymore.

948
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:17,512
Haven't gotten lost in the woods, have you?

949
01:31:20,683 --> 01:31:22,142
Your last report was

950
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:23,601
more than two weeks ago.

951
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:28,314
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

952
01:31:30,901 --> 01:31:33,486
The way I see it, it's time to terminate the mission.

953
01:31:33,487 --> 01:31:35,363
No, I can do this.

954
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:37,073
You already have.

955
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:40,285
You give me good, usable intel.

956
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:42,495
This Tree of Souls place.

957
01:31:42,955 --> 01:31:44,784
Yeah, I got them by the balls

958
01:31:44,785 --> 01:31:46,332
with that when this turns into a shit fight,

959
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:48,168
which it will. Yeah.

960
01:31:49,128 --> 01:31:51,129
Now it's time to come in.

961
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,466
By the way,

962
01:31:54,967 --> 01:31:56,968
you gonna get your legs back.

963
01:31:57,845 --> 01:32:01,514
Yeah. I got your corporate approval. It's a done deal.

964
01:32:01,515 --> 01:32:03,975
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

965
01:32:04,059 --> 01:32:05,852
I'm a man of my word.

966
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:10,523
I gotta finish this.

967
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:14,360
There's one more thing.

968
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:20,033
Ceremony. It's the final stage of becoming a man.

969
01:32:22,536 --> 01:32:24,662
If I do it, I'm one of them.

970
01:32:26,165 --> 01:32:27,957
And they'll trust me.

971
01:32:31,587 --> 01:32:34,798
And I can negotiate the terms of their relocation.

972
01:32:48,395 --> 01:32:50,897
Well, then, you'd better get it done, Corporal.

973
01:33:08,332 --> 01:33:12,335
The Na'vi say that every person is born twice.

974
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:15,516
The second time is

975
01:33:15,517 --> 01:33:19,759
when you earn your place among The People forever.

976
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:29,561
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

977
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:34,023
You are part of The People.

978
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,322
Come. Come.

979
01:34:39,965 --> 01:34:42,675
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

980
01:34:44,303 --> 01:34:46,179
And sometimes answered.

981
01:34:54,021 --> 01:34:56,731
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.

982
01:34:57,733 --> 01:34:59,484
The Tree of Voices.

983
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:03,655
The voices of our ancestors.

984
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:20,254
I can hear them.

985
01:35:25,177 --> 01:35:26,803
They live, Jake,

986
01:35:28,847 --> 01:35:30,264
within Eywa.

987
01:35:34,436 --> 01:35:36,312
You are Omaticaya now.

988
01:35:37,022 --> 01:35:40,149
You may make your bow from the wood of Hometree.

989
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:47,740
And you may choose a woman.

990
01:35:49,868 --> 01:35:51,828
We have many fine women.

991
01:35:53,038 --> 01:35:55,039
Ninat is the best singer.

992
01:35:57,918 --> 01:35:59,836
But I don't want Ninat.

993
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:06,092
Beyral is a good hunter.

994
01:36:07,761 --> 01:36:09,846
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

995
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:13,683
I've already chosen.

996
01:36:17,187 --> 01:36:19,689
But this woman must also choose me.

997
01:36:23,694 --> 01:36:25,319
She already has.

998
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:21,709
I am with you now, Jake.

999
01:37:23,253 --> 01:37:25,129
We are mated for life.

1000
01:37:31,428 --> 01:37:33,471
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

1001
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:05,044
Ma Jake!

1002
01:38:05,128 --> 01:38:06,420
Don't forget your phase integration.

1003
01:38:06,505 --> 01:38:07,839
- Jake! - No, no, the middle button.

1004
01:38:07,923 --> 01:38:09,841
- You gotta eat something. - Yeah, there you go.

1005
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:23,229
Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!

1006
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:26,357
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

1007
01:38:27,526 --> 01:38:29,110
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

1008
01:38:32,906 --> 01:38:34,031
Jake!

1009
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:44,041
Okay.

1010
01:38:55,137 --> 01:38:57,221
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

1011
01:38:57,222 --> 01:38:59,557
And when was the last time you took a shower?

1012
01:38:59,558 --> 01:39:01,642
- I don't need a shower. - Jesus, Marine.

1013
01:39:05,772 --> 01:39:07,064
Jake!

1014
01:39:13,822 --> 01:39:18,743
Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up!

1015
01:39:22,247 --> 01:39:23,581
Hey!

1016
01:39:24,249 --> 01:39:26,751
Stop! Stop!

1017
01:39:26,752 --> 01:39:29,587
- Jake! - Go back, stop!

1018
01:39:33,759 --> 01:39:35,092
Hey, boss.

1019
01:39:35,594 --> 01:39:36,761
Hey!

1020
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:40,431
- What? - I got a native

1021
01:39:40,515 --> 01:39:43,476
doing the funky chicken here. He's blocking my blade.

1022
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:46,687
Well, keep going. He'll move.

1023
01:39:46,772 --> 01:39:48,746
These people have to learn that we don't stop.

1024
01:39:48,747 --> 01:39:50,024
Come on, go, go, go.

1025
01:39:52,361 --> 01:39:54,570
Stop! Hey!

1026
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:56,948
Go! Go!

1027
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,408
There, see? He moved.

1028
01:40:11,797 --> 01:40:14,674
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, no!

1029
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:15,675
I'm blind.

1030
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:29,855
- Jake! - Neytiri!

1031
01:40:31,441 --> 01:40:33,109
Here, come on!

1032
01:40:58,010 --> 01:41:00,594
Freeze it right there.

1033
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:04,640
Scale up. Enhance.

1034
01:41:06,268 --> 01:41:07,810
Son of a bitch.

1035
01:41:09,312 --> 01:41:10,771
Unbelievable.

1036
01:41:11,857 --> 01:41:13,983
- Get me a pilot. - Yes, sir.

1037
01:41:20,782 --> 01:41:22,950
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

1038
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:30,833
Stop please!

1039
01:41:32,335 --> 01:41:34,462
This will only make it worse.

1040
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:36,255
You do not speak here!

1041
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:39,216
We will strike them in the heart.

1042
01:41:47,017 --> 01:41:49,185
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

1043
01:41:52,314 --> 01:41:53,856
- You! - Listen. Brother...

1044
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:02,490
- You mated with this woman? - Oh, shit.

1045
01:42:03,742 --> 01:42:05,743
Is this true?

1046
01:42:07,245 --> 01:42:10,456
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

1047
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:13,000
Brother, please.

1048
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:14,729
Do not attack the Sky People.

1049
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:16,921
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

1050
01:42:16,922 --> 01:42:19,256
You are not my brother!

1051
01:42:22,427 --> 01:42:24,220
And I am not your enemy!

1052
01:42:25,847 --> 01:42:28,724
The enemy is out there, and they are very powerful!

1053
01:42:30,977 --> 01:42:32,770
Go! Go! Go!

1054
01:42:35,982 --> 01:42:38,484
- I can talk to them. - No more talk.

1055
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:39,902
Tsu'tey!

1056
01:42:46,118 --> 01:42:49,036
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

1057
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:52,081
And I have the right to speak.

1058
01:42:56,711 --> 01:42:58,587
I have something to say...

1059
01:43:00,924 --> 01:43:02,383
...to all of you.

1060
01:43:06,429 --> 01:43:08,514
The words are like stones in my heart.

1061
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:14,854
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!

1062
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:17,148
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

1063
01:43:18,316 --> 01:43:19,650
It's very dangerous!

1064
01:43:22,279 --> 01:43:23,445
Grace!

1065
01:43:24,656 --> 01:43:25,865
Oh, no.

1066
01:43:26,074 --> 01:43:28,075
- Wait! - Stay down, sir.

1067
01:43:29,578 --> 01:43:31,829
Okay. Look...

1068
01:43:32,914 --> 01:43:34,248
I was sent here to...

1069
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:39,295
You see?

1070
01:43:39,462 --> 01:43:41,922
It is a demon in a false body.

1071
01:44:01,818 --> 01:44:05,196
- Are you out of your goddamn mind? - You crossed the line.

1072
01:44:08,658 --> 01:44:10,826
Wheel this meat out of here.

1073
01:44:12,537 --> 01:44:15,080
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

1074
01:44:18,335 --> 01:44:20,127
You let me down, son.

1075
01:44:22,088 --> 01:44:23,380
So, what,

1076
01:44:24,883 --> 01:44:26,926
you find yourself some local tail

1077
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:30,137
and you just completely forget what team you're playing for?

1078
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:32,723
Parker, there is time to salvage the situation.

1079
01:44:32,807 --> 01:44:35,392
- Parker... - Shut your pie hole!

1080
01:44:35,393 --> 01:44:39,605
Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me?

1081
01:44:39,689 --> 01:44:42,441
- I could do that. - You need to muzzle your dog.

1082
01:44:42,525 --> 01:44:45,277
Yeah, can we just take this down a couple of notches, please?

1083
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:47,905
You say you want to keep your people alive?

1084
01:44:47,906 --> 01:44:49,949
You start by listening to her.

1085
01:44:50,033 --> 01:44:52,326
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

1086
01:44:52,410 --> 01:44:53,762
in a way you can't imagine.

1087
01:44:53,763 --> 01:44:54,245
You know what?

1088
01:44:54,246 --> 01:44:56,622
You throw a stick in the air around here,

1089
01:44:56,623 --> 01:44:59,625
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

1090
01:44:59,709 --> 01:45:01,126
- for Christ's sake! - I'm not talking

1091
01:45:01,127 --> 01:45:05,631
about some kind of pagan voodoo here. I'm talking about something real,

1092
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:07,800
something measurable in the biology of the forest.

1093
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:08,300
Something measurable in the biology of the forest.

1094
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:09,885
Which is what, exactly?

1095
01:45:10,929 --> 01:45:12,304
What we think we know

1096
01:45:12,305 --> 01:45:15,766
is that there is some kind of electrochemical communication

1097
01:45:15,767 --> 01:45:17,977
between the roots of the trees,

1098
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:20,187
like the synapses between neurons.

1099
01:45:20,272 --> 01:45:24,858
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth connections to the trees around it.

1100
01:45:24,943 --> 01:45:28,112
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees on Pandora.

1101
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:31,323
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

1102
01:45:31,324 --> 01:45:33,742
It's more connections than the human brain.

1103
01:45:34,911 --> 01:45:37,496
Get it? It's a network.

1104
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:40,541
It's a global network, and the Na'vi can access it.

1105
01:45:40,625 --> 01:45:44,169
They can upload and download data. Memories.

1106
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:46,922
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

1107
01:45:47,507 --> 01:45:48,590
Yes!

1108
01:45:49,801 --> 01:45:53,929
What the hell have you people been smoking out there?

1109
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:56,640
They're just goddamn trees!

1110
01:45:58,393 --> 01:45:59,789
You need to wake up, Parker.

1111
01:45:59,790 --> 01:46:01,186
No. You need to wake up.

1112
01:46:01,187 --> 01:46:04,053
The wealth of this world isn't in the ground.

1113
01:46:04,054 --> 01:46:05,691
It's all around us.

1114
01:46:05,775 --> 01:46:09,486
The Na'vi know that, and they are fighting to defend it.

1115
01:46:09,571 --> 01:46:12,491
If you want to share this world with them,

1116
01:46:12,492 --> 01:46:13,866
you need to understand them.

1117
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:17,030
I'd say we understand them just fine,

1118
01:46:17,031 --> 01:46:18,662
thanks to Jake here.

1119
01:46:20,373 --> 01:46:22,833
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

1120
01:46:22,917 --> 01:46:25,169
They're not gonna give up their home.

1121
01:46:26,963 --> 01:46:28,630
They're not gonna make a deal.

1122
01:46:29,674 --> 01:46:31,967
For what? Lite beer?

1123
01:46:32,552 --> 01:46:34,094
And blue jeans?

1124
01:46:37,349 --> 01:46:40,225
There's nothing that we have that they want.

1125
01:46:42,145 --> 01:46:45,189
Everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time.

1126
01:46:50,111 --> 01:46:51,528
They're never gonna leave Hometree.

1127
01:46:54,407 --> 01:46:56,980
So, since a deal can't be made,

1128
01:46:56,981 --> 01:47:00,412
I guess things get real simple.

1129
01:47:00,622 --> 01:47:05,125
Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.

1130
01:47:05,168 --> 01:47:07,795
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

1131
01:47:33,488 --> 01:47:35,197
Talk to me, Lyle.

1132
01:47:35,532 --> 01:47:38,075
It looks like they hit it with banshees first.

1133
01:47:38,201 --> 01:47:39,868
See the angle's steep?

1134
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:46,125
They set the ampsuit on fire.

1135
01:47:46,501 --> 01:47:47,709
Driver's toast.

1136
01:47:49,212 --> 01:47:50,963
The rest of the squad?

1137
01:47:52,132 --> 01:47:55,050
Six bodies. That's all of them.

1138
01:47:56,511 --> 01:47:57,719
The equipment's totaled.

1139
01:48:00,557 --> 01:48:03,016
Jesus Christ.

1140
01:48:06,187 --> 01:48:09,565
I'll do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous.

1141
01:48:10,442 --> 01:48:12,943
I'll drive them out with gas first.

1142
01:48:14,195 --> 01:48:15,779
It'll be humane.

1143
01:48:17,407 --> 01:48:18,866
More or less.

1144
01:48:20,577 --> 01:48:22,411
All right, let's pull the trigger.

1145
01:48:25,874 --> 01:48:28,250
Come on, people. Let's get it packed, let's go.

1146
01:48:28,585 --> 01:48:31,753
You know, they never even wanted us to succeed.

1147
01:48:32,589 --> 01:48:37,025
They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose

1148
01:48:37,026 --> 01:48:38,135
to trigger a response.

1149
01:48:38,219 --> 01:48:39,750
Just fabricating this war

1150
01:48:39,751 --> 01:48:40,929
to get what they want.

1151
01:48:41,514 --> 01:48:43,390
This is how it's done.

1152
01:48:46,186 --> 01:48:49,480
When people are sitting on shit that you want,

1153
01:48:49,564 --> 01:48:51,322
you make them your enemy.

1154
01:48:51,323 --> 01:48:53,609
Then you're justified in taking it.

1155
01:48:53,693 --> 01:48:55,889
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.

1156
01:48:55,890 --> 01:48:56,987
He's gonna hit Hometree.

1157
01:48:57,071 --> 01:48:58,071
My God.

1158
01:49:04,537 --> 01:49:08,016
Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!

1159
01:49:08,017 --> 01:49:08,790
Back off!

1160
01:49:08,791 --> 01:49:10,861
Parker. Wait. Stop.

1161
01:49:10,862 --> 01:49:12,586
These are people you're about to...

1162
01:49:12,587 --> 01:49:13,754
- No. No, no, no, no. - I said back off!

1163
01:49:13,755 --> 01:49:17,257
They're fly-bitten savages that live in a tree!

1164
01:49:17,258 --> 01:49:18,967
All right? Look around!

1165
01:49:19,052 --> 01:49:20,443
I don't know about you,

1166
01:49:20,444 --> 01:49:22,763
but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

1167
01:49:22,847 --> 01:49:23,798
Can you guys just please...

1168
01:49:23,799 --> 01:49:24,306
Yes, sir.

1169
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:26,975
There are families in there. There are children. Babies.

1170
01:49:26,976 --> 01:49:28,268
Are you gonna kill children?

1171
01:49:28,353 --> 01:49:32,272
You don't want that kind of blood on your hands. Believe me.

1172
01:49:32,357 --> 01:49:34,775
Just let me try to talk them out.

1173
01:49:35,568 --> 01:49:37,069
They trust me.

1174
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:42,824
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

1175
01:49:42,825 --> 01:49:44,826
Calibrating three and four.

1176
01:49:44,827 --> 01:49:47,788
- Run sequence. - Initiating. Thirty seconds.

1177
01:49:52,168 --> 01:49:53,961
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

1178
01:49:53,962 --> 01:49:56,630
Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the ax comes down,

1179
01:49:56,631 --> 01:49:59,299
you get them to evacuate. One hour.

1180
01:50:05,348 --> 01:50:06,473
Father!

1181
01:50:06,641 --> 01:50:07,683
Mother!

1182
01:50:07,684 --> 01:50:10,936
Eytukan, I have something to say.

1183
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:12,437
Listen!

1184
01:50:13,481 --> 01:50:14,940
Speak, Jakesully.

1185
01:50:16,317 --> 01:50:19,278
A great evil is upon us...

1186
01:50:19,612 --> 01:50:21,488
The Sky People are coming...

1187
01:50:21,739 --> 01:50:24,241
...to destroy Hometree.

1188
01:50:26,703 --> 01:50:28,161
Look, tell them they're gonna be here soon.

1189
01:50:30,707 --> 01:50:33,542
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

1190
01:50:33,543 --> 01:50:35,502
Are you certain of this?

1191
01:50:39,299 --> 01:50:43,010
Look, they sent me here to learn your ways

1192
01:50:44,178 --> 01:50:46,585
so one day I could bring this message

1193
01:50:46,586 --> 01:50:47,472
and that you would believe it.

1194
01:50:50,018 --> 01:50:51,910
What are you saying, Jake?

1195
01:50:51,911 --> 01:50:53,645
You knew this would happen?

1196
01:50:56,858 --> 01:50:58,400
Yes.

1197
01:50:58,401 --> 01:51:00,861
Look, at first it was just orders,

1198
01:51:02,363 --> 01:51:04,740
and then everything changed.

1199
01:51:04,741 --> 01:51:06,533
Okay? I fell in love.

1200
01:51:07,201 --> 01:51:12,497
I fell in love with the forest and with the Omaticaya people.

1201
01:51:13,666 --> 01:51:15,125
And with you.

1202
01:51:16,085 --> 01:51:17,919
- I trusted you. - With you. With you.

1203
01:51:18,004 --> 01:51:20,881
- I trusted you! - Trust me now, please.

1204
01:51:28,222 --> 01:51:30,724
You will never be one of The People!

1205
01:51:30,725 --> 01:51:32,601
- I shouldn't have... - We tried to stop them!

1206
01:51:32,602 --> 01:51:34,645
Neytiri, please! Please.

1207
01:51:39,567 --> 01:51:40,734
Bind them.

1208
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:43,487
Leave now!

1209
01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:46,990
You have to go. They're coming!

1210
01:52:00,838 --> 01:52:03,090
Time on target, one mike.

1211
01:52:03,091 --> 01:52:05,133
Copy. We have a visual.

1212
01:52:05,134 --> 01:52:08,178
Roger that. Stay on heading 030.

1213
01:52:08,262 --> 01:52:09,596
Roger, 030.

1214
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:25,445
- Run to the forest! - They're coming!

1215
01:52:27,073 --> 01:52:28,914
They will destroy this place.

1216
01:52:28,915 --> 01:52:30,909
Neytiri, you must go now!

1217
01:52:34,664 --> 01:52:36,957
Run to the forest! Run!

1218
01:52:39,335 --> 01:52:40,669
Run! Run!

1219
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:44,339
Have no fear.

1220
01:53:01,190 --> 01:53:04,943
No! God damn it, run!

1221
01:53:05,153 --> 01:53:06,695
Take the ikran...

1222
01:53:06,696 --> 01:53:08,280
...attack from above.

1223
01:53:12,535 --> 01:53:14,745
That is one big damn tree.

1224
01:53:22,253 --> 01:53:26,465
Well, well, well. I'd say diplomacy has failed.

1225
01:53:28,426 --> 01:53:30,510
All right, people, let's get this done!

1226
01:53:30,595 --> 01:53:33,513
I want every gas round you got right in the front door.

1227
01:53:33,514 --> 01:53:35,557
Roger. CS.40's going hot.

1228
01:53:35,933 --> 01:53:37,142
- Fire. - Firing.

1229
01:53:48,571 --> 01:53:50,614
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

1230
01:53:58,539 --> 01:54:00,207
Sir, they've opened fire.

1231
01:54:02,084 --> 01:54:03,835
You've got to be kidding me!

1232
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:18,892
These dumb bastardsain't getting the message.

1233
01:54:18,976 --> 01:54:20,727
All right, let's turn up the heat.

1234
01:54:20,728 --> 01:54:23,730
- Switch incendiaries! - Switching incendiaries.

1235
01:54:23,731 --> 01:54:24,856
Fire.

1236
01:54:28,152 --> 01:54:29,236
No!

1237
01:54:42,458 --> 01:54:44,209
Get everyone to the forest.

1238
01:54:47,588 --> 01:54:49,798
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

1239
01:54:53,553 --> 01:54:54,761
Neytiri!

1240
01:55:03,437 --> 01:55:06,481
We gotta move! He's gonna blow the columns!

1241
01:55:06,566 --> 01:55:07,858
My God!

1242
01:55:26,419 --> 01:55:29,796
- Mo'at! No! - Lf you are one of us,

1243
01:55:31,299 --> 01:55:32,632
help us.

1244
01:55:40,391 --> 01:55:42,392
All call signs, switch missiles.

1245
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,978
Give me HE's at the base of the west columns.

1246
01:55:46,939 --> 01:55:48,189
This way!

1247
01:55:49,317 --> 01:55:51,192
Rider section, switch missiles.

1248
01:55:51,277 --> 01:55:53,236
- One's good. - Two's rocks up.

1249
01:55:53,321 --> 01:55:55,864
- Three's up. - Yeah, baby, get some!

1250
01:55:56,407 --> 01:55:58,658
Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.

1251
01:55:58,743 --> 01:56:00,160
- Bring it down. - Cleared hot.

1252
01:56:07,209 --> 01:56:08,793
Come on, Grace, move!

1253
01:56:11,422 --> 01:56:13,006
Down! Head down!

1254
01:56:15,593 --> 01:56:17,844
Come on, come on! Down!

1255
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:24,601
- Solid hits. - Solid rocks on target.

1256
01:56:24,685 --> 01:56:25,852
Screw this.

1257
01:56:27,104 --> 01:56:29,105
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1258
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:30,982
I didn't sign up for this shit!

1259
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:42,535
Repeat. Ripple fire.

1260
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:27,622
Go! Go! Go!

1261
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:03,199
No, no, get back! Back!

1262
01:58:22,219 --> 01:58:24,804
Come on! Come on, move! Move!

1263
01:59:09,809 --> 01:59:13,436
That's good work, people. First round's on me tonight.

1264
01:59:14,105 --> 01:59:15,355
Let's boogie.

1265
01:59:15,773 --> 01:59:18,191
Dragon coming left, heading home.

1266
01:59:18,651 --> 01:59:20,568
Gunrunner coming left.

1267
01:59:20,653 --> 01:59:23,196
- Thunder copies. - Rider section copies.

1268
01:59:30,788 --> 01:59:31,871
Father!

1269
01:59:47,721 --> 01:59:49,055
Daughter...

1270
01:59:50,224 --> 01:59:53,309
take... my... bow.

1271
01:59:57,439 --> 02:00:01,901
Protect The People.

1272
02:00:10,286 --> 02:00:11,536
Neytiri!

1273
02:00:21,589 --> 02:00:25,300
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Get away.

1274
02:00:25,968 --> 02:00:27,260
Get away!

1275
02:00:28,345 --> 02:00:30,096
Get away from here!

1276
02:00:31,557 --> 02:00:33,141
Never come back!

1277
02:00:50,826 --> 02:00:51,951
Pull the plug.

1278
02:00:52,953 --> 02:00:54,859
No, you can't do that!

1279
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:55,622
You can't do that!

1280
02:00:55,623 --> 02:00:57,624
- Calm down! Calm down! - No! Please!

1281
02:01:13,807 --> 02:01:16,351
I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace.

1282
02:01:17,770 --> 02:01:21,648
Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up.

1283
02:01:24,485 --> 02:01:25,944
Let's go!

1284
02:01:33,786 --> 02:01:35,370
Put him down!

1285
02:01:38,749 --> 02:01:41,501
You murderer!

1286
02:02:28,132 --> 02:02:30,216
What's going on, brother? Long time no see.

1287
02:02:30,301 --> 02:02:31,384
Hey.

1288
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:35,430
Personally, I don't feel these tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1289
02:02:35,514 --> 02:02:38,891
They get steak? That's bullshit. Let me see that.

1290
02:02:39,893 --> 02:02:42,437
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1291
02:02:42,521 --> 02:02:45,064
- Trudy! - All the way down.

1292
02:02:48,444 --> 02:02:49,694
Max!

1293
02:02:59,747 --> 02:03:02,248
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1294
02:03:02,833 --> 02:03:03,916
Here.

1295
02:03:16,013 --> 02:03:18,473
- Clear. Come on. - Here you go.

1296
02:03:34,031 --> 02:03:36,011
Max, stay here.

1297
02:03:36,012 --> 02:03:37,992
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1298
02:03:37,993 --> 02:03:39,285
Okay. Go.

1299
02:03:53,092 --> 02:03:54,258
Clear.

1300
02:03:56,220 --> 02:03:57,512
Come on, baby.

1301
02:03:57,513 --> 02:04:00,306
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

1302
02:04:03,936 --> 02:04:06,979
It's Samson 1-6. Unauthorized engine start.

1303
02:04:10,025 --> 02:04:11,317
Three!

1304
02:04:14,154 --> 02:04:15,363
Come on!

1305
02:04:17,324 --> 02:04:18,658
Mask on!

1306
02:04:21,245 --> 02:04:23,079
Gas, gas, gas!

1307
02:04:24,706 --> 02:04:26,749
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

1308
02:04:29,211 --> 02:04:32,338
Grab my hand! Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1309
02:04:33,340 --> 02:04:35,174
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

1310
02:04:47,813 --> 02:04:49,147
Colonel!

1311
02:04:55,863 --> 02:04:59,407
- Yeah! Yeah! - All right! Yes!

1312
02:05:02,619 --> 02:05:05,288
- Crap. - Everybody all right back there?

1313
02:05:05,372 --> 02:05:06,914
Oh, yeah, baby!

1314
02:05:06,915 --> 02:05:08,833
- Norm, you good? - Yeah!

1315
02:05:09,710 --> 02:05:12,044
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1316
02:05:12,296 --> 02:05:14,088
- Grace is hit! - What?

1317
02:05:15,215 --> 02:05:16,883
- Get the trauma kit. - Trauma kit!

1318
02:05:16,884 --> 02:05:18,635
Keep the pressure on, Grace.

1319
02:05:18,636 --> 02:05:20,386
Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1320
02:05:20,471 --> 02:05:24,974
- Hang on, Grace. - Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1321
02:05:28,312 --> 02:05:30,771
- You're good to go. - Take it up!

1322
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:33,774
Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.

1323
02:05:38,197 --> 02:05:39,655
You're clear!

1324
02:05:47,581 --> 02:05:50,333
Just keep going north. Get us deep in the mountains.

1325
02:05:50,417 --> 02:05:51,834
Copy that.

1326
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,858
Norm, you all good up there?

1327
02:06:00,859 --> 02:06:02,094
Yep! Still here.

1328
02:06:03,972 --> 02:06:06,666
Well, at least they can't track us up here.

1329
02:06:06,667 --> 02:06:08,643
Not this far into the Vortex.

1330
02:06:08,727 --> 02:06:10,770
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?

1331
02:06:10,854 --> 02:06:12,355
Yeah.

1332
02:06:12,439 --> 02:06:14,398
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

1333
02:06:23,242 --> 02:06:24,408
Ouch.

1334
02:06:27,788 --> 02:06:29,247
You big baby.

1335
02:06:30,582 --> 02:06:32,041
We're moving.

1336
02:06:32,584 --> 02:06:34,627
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1337
02:06:35,587 --> 02:06:37,755
I'm a scientist, remember?

1338
02:06:38,674 --> 02:06:41,133
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1339
02:06:41,969 --> 02:06:43,886
The People can help you.

1340
02:06:44,346 --> 02:06:45,638
I know it.

1341
02:06:47,641 --> 02:06:49,517
Why would they help us?

1342
02:07:05,534 --> 02:07:08,661
The People say Eywa will provide.

1343
02:07:10,581 --> 02:07:13,291
With no home, no hope,

1344
02:07:14,334 --> 02:07:16,502
there was only one place they could go.

1345
02:07:30,934 --> 02:07:32,143
Link's running.

1346
02:07:32,853 --> 02:07:35,855
- What's the plan here, Jake? - There's no plan.

1347
02:07:36,898 --> 02:07:39,122
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.

1348
02:07:39,123 --> 02:07:41,569
He's not gonna let you near that place.

1349
02:07:42,529 --> 02:07:43,946
I gotta try.

1350
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:48,034
Launching.

1351
02:08:09,514 --> 02:08:10,723
Outcast.

1352
02:08:11,516 --> 02:08:12,767
Betrayer.

1353
02:08:13,852 --> 02:08:15,019
Alien.

1354
02:08:16,563 --> 02:08:19,273
I was in the place the eye does not see.

1355
02:08:30,452 --> 02:08:34,330
I needed their help, and they needed mine.

1356
02:08:35,248 --> 02:08:37,291
But to ever face them again,

1357
02:08:37,292 --> 02:08:39,794
I was gonna have to take it to a whole new level.

1358
02:08:48,345 --> 02:08:51,681
Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move.

1359
02:08:54,434 --> 02:08:56,811
There's something we gotta do.

1360
02:08:56,895 --> 02:08:58,604
You're not gonna like it.

1361
02:09:08,615 --> 02:09:12,493
The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.

1362
02:09:12,494 --> 02:09:14,161
Nothing attacks him.

1363
02:09:14,663 --> 02:09:15,996
Easy, boy.

1364
02:09:16,456 --> 02:09:18,290
So why would he ever look up?

1365
02:09:19,418 --> 02:09:21,043
But that was just a theory.

1366
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:33,365
Toruk Macto?

1367
02:11:13,156 --> 02:11:14,657
I See you.

1368
02:11:17,744 --> 02:11:19,078
I See you.

1369
02:11:27,379 --> 02:11:29,088
I was afraid, Jake.

1370
02:11:30,507 --> 02:11:32,007
For my people.

1371
02:11:35,053 --> 02:11:36,679
I'm not anymore.

1372
02:11:46,106 --> 02:11:48,440
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

1373
02:11:49,067 --> 02:11:51,110
...I stand before you...

1374
02:11:52,112 --> 02:11:55,281
...ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

1375
02:11:57,868 --> 02:12:02,121
You are Olo'eyktan, and you are a great warrior.

1376
02:12:03,290 --> 02:12:05,457
I can't do this without you.

1377
02:12:12,507 --> 02:12:13,924
Toruk Macto,

1378
02:12:21,766 --> 02:12:23,517
I will fly with you.

1379
02:12:26,813 --> 02:12:28,564
My friend is dying.

1380
02:12:30,942 --> 02:12:32,484
Grace is dying.

1381
02:12:34,487 --> 02:12:36,322
I beg the help of Eywa.

1382
02:12:48,251 --> 02:12:50,252
Look where we are, Grace.

1383
02:12:56,968 --> 02:12:59,345
I need to take some samples.

1384
02:13:22,786 --> 02:13:26,872
The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is

1385
02:13:28,083 --> 02:13:29,541
in this body.

1386
02:13:32,087 --> 02:13:33,754
Is that possible?

1387
02:13:33,838 --> 02:13:38,342
She must pass through the eye of Eywa and return.

1388
02:13:39,594 --> 02:13:41,136
But, Jakesully,

1389
02:13:42,138 --> 02:13:43,764
she is very weak.

1390
02:13:45,225 --> 02:13:48,060
Hang on, Grace. They're gonna fix you up.

1391
02:13:51,231 --> 02:13:53,857
Hear us please, All Mother.

1392
02:13:54,401 --> 02:13:56,735
Eywa, help her.

1393
02:13:57,404 --> 02:13:59,613
Take this spirit into you...

1394
02:14:03,159 --> 02:14:05,411
...and breathe her back to us.

1395
02:14:09,207 --> 02:14:10,874
Let her walk among us...

1396
02:14:13,378 --> 02:14:15,337
...as one of The People.

1397
02:14:44,284 --> 02:14:45,367
Jake.

1398
02:14:47,787 --> 02:14:48,954
Grace.

1399
02:14:51,082 --> 02:14:52,791
I'm with her, Jake.

1400
02:14:54,794 --> 02:14:56,170
She's real!

1401
02:14:59,215 --> 02:15:02,384
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

1402
02:15:03,553 --> 02:15:05,179
What's happening?

1403
02:15:06,139 --> 02:15:07,806
What's happening?

1404
02:15:12,145 --> 02:15:13,312
Grace!

1405
02:15:14,022 --> 02:15:15,189
Grace!

1406
02:15:17,275 --> 02:15:18,901
What's happening?

1407
02:15:25,158 --> 02:15:26,575
Did it work?

1408
02:15:32,248 --> 02:15:36,335
Her wounds were too great. It was not enough time.

1409
02:15:38,004 --> 02:15:39,755
She is with Eywa now.

1410
02:16:13,540 --> 02:16:16,208
With your permission, I will speak now.

1411
02:16:18,586 --> 02:16:21,046
You would honor me by translating.

1412
02:16:28,138 --> 02:16:30,347
The Sky People have sent us a message

1413
02:16:33,726 --> 02:16:36,145
that they can take whatever they want

1414
02:16:37,939 --> 02:16:39,731
and no one can stop them.

1415
02:16:43,319 --> 02:16:45,112
Well, we will send them a message.

1416
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:50,075
You ride out as fast as the wind can carry you.

1417
02:16:53,371 --> 02:16:55,747
You tell the other clans to come.

1418
02:16:58,877 --> 02:17:01,378
You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.

1419
02:17:03,590 --> 02:17:06,383
And you fly now with me!

1420
02:17:07,427 --> 02:17:09,928
My brothers! Sisters!

1421
02:17:11,014 --> 02:17:13,098
And we will show the Sky People

1422
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:15,976
that they cannot take whatever they want,

1423
02:17:17,478 --> 02:17:18,937
and that this,

1424
02:17:19,647 --> 02:17:20,689
this is our land!

1425
02:17:27,780 --> 02:17:29,239
Yah!

1426
02:17:44,339 --> 02:17:45,756
Yah!

1427
02:18:15,161 --> 02:18:16,536
Yah!

1428
02:18:34,055 --> 02:18:35,555
We rode out to the four winds.

1429
02:18:38,309 --> 02:18:40,727
To the horse clans of the plain.

1430
02:18:43,690 --> 02:18:44,731
Back to the stars!

1431
02:18:44,816 --> 02:18:47,067
To the ikran people ofthe Eastern Sea.

1432
02:18:47,068 --> 02:18:48,360
For our children's children!

1433
02:18:48,444 --> 02:18:51,029
When Toruk Macto called them, they came.

1434
02:18:54,867 --> 02:18:56,243
Yah!

1435
02:19:32,405 --> 02:19:34,906
Everyone on this base, every one of you,

1436
02:19:34,991 --> 02:19:36,825
is fighting for survival.

1437
02:19:36,909 --> 02:19:38,410
That's a fact!

1438
02:19:39,245 --> 02:19:42,283
There's an aboriginal horde out there

1439
02:19:42,284 --> 02:19:42,998
massing for an attack.

1440
02:19:44,083 --> 02:19:47,961
Now, these orbital images tell me

1441
02:19:48,379 --> 02:19:51,631
that the hostiles' numbers have gone from a few hundred

1442
02:19:51,632 --> 02:19:54,217
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1443
02:19:54,761 --> 02:19:56,762
And more are pouring in.

1444
02:19:59,223 --> 02:20:02,642
In a week's time, there could be 20,000 of them.

1445
02:20:02,727 --> 02:20:05,103
At that point, they will overrun our perimeter.

1446
02:20:05,104 --> 02:20:07,356
Well, that's not gonna happen!

1447
02:20:08,941 --> 02:20:12,611
Our only security lies in pre-emptive attack.

1448
02:20:12,612 --> 02:20:15,030
We will fight terror with terror.

1449
02:20:19,327 --> 02:20:23,497
Now, the hostiles believe that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1450
02:20:23,581 --> 02:20:25,999
is protected by their...

1451
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,417
Their deity.

1452
02:20:28,711 --> 02:20:30,837
And when we destroy it,

1453
02:20:30,838 --> 02:20:33,215
we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep

1454
02:20:33,299 --> 02:20:34,974
that they won't come

1455
02:20:34,975 --> 02:20:36,802
within 1,000 klicks of this place ever again.

1456
02:20:36,886 --> 02:20:39,596
And that, too, is a fact.

1457
02:20:40,306 --> 02:20:42,057
Yeah! Yeah.

1458
02:20:52,527 --> 02:20:55,002
Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.

1459
02:20:55,003 --> 02:20:56,488
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.

1460
02:20:56,572 --> 02:20:57,746
They've got these huge pallets

1461
02:20:57,747 --> 02:20:58,824
of mine explosives.

1462
02:20:58,908 --> 02:21:01,827
It's for some kind of shock-and-awe campaign.

1463
02:21:01,911 --> 02:21:03,829
Fricking daisy cutters!

1464
02:21:05,331 --> 02:21:06,308
Quaritch has taken over.

1465
02:21:06,309 --> 02:21:08,166
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.

1466
02:21:08,251 --> 02:21:10,335
- When?  - 06:00 tomorrow.

1467
02:21:10,420 --> 02:21:12,295
- Max! Max!  - I gotta go.

1468
02:21:14,173 --> 02:21:15,674
We're screwed!

1469
02:21:17,135 --> 02:21:19,386
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical plan

1470
02:21:19,387 --> 02:21:21,638
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1471
02:21:23,099 --> 02:21:26,476
We're going up against gunships with bows and arrows.

1472
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:31,523
I have 15 clans out there.

1473
02:21:32,191 --> 02:21:34,317
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1474
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:37,547
Now, we know these mountains.

1475
02:21:37,548 --> 02:21:40,282
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1476
02:21:41,325 --> 02:21:43,752
Their instruments won't work up here.

1477
02:21:43,753 --> 02:21:45,370
Missile tracking won't work.

1478
02:21:45,872 --> 02:21:47,372
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1479
02:21:47,457 --> 02:21:51,710
If they bring the fight to us, then we have the home-field advantage.

1480
02:21:53,588 --> 02:21:57,048
You know he's gonna commit that bomber straight to the Tree of Souls.

1481
02:21:57,133 --> 02:21:58,383
Yeah, I know.

1482
02:21:58,384 --> 02:22:00,927
If they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.

1483
02:22:01,012 --> 02:22:04,222
That's their direct line to Eywa, their ancestors.

1484
02:22:05,016 --> 02:22:07,058
It'll destroy them.

1485
02:22:07,059 --> 02:22:09,519
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1486
02:22:24,577 --> 02:22:27,579
I'm probably just talking to a tree right now.

1487
02:22:29,999 --> 02:22:34,753
But if you're there, I need to give you a heads-up.

1488
02:22:37,298 --> 02:22:41,718
If Grace is with you, look into her memories.

1489
02:22:42,970 --> 02:22:45,096
See the world we come from.

1490
02:22:46,182 --> 02:22:48,099
There's no green there.

1491
02:22:49,477 --> 02:22:51,478
They killed their Mother.

1492
02:22:52,271 --> 02:22:54,773
And they're gonna do the same here.

1493
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:58,985
More Sky People are gonna come.

1494
02:22:59,070 --> 02:23:02,113
They're gonna come like a rain that never ends.

1495
02:23:03,407 --> 02:23:05,158
Unless we stop them.

1496
02:23:07,745 --> 02:23:10,830
Look, you chose me for something.

1497
02:23:12,291 --> 02:23:14,167
I will stand and fight.

1498
02:23:15,211 --> 02:23:16,795
You know I will.

1499
02:23:19,298 --> 02:23:21,550
But I need a little help here.

1500
02:23:27,682 --> 02:23:30,725
Our Great Mother does not take sides, Jake.

1501
02:23:32,520 --> 02:23:35,981
She protects only the balance of life.

1502
02:23:47,785 --> 02:23:49,494
It was worth a try.

1503
02:24:20,192 --> 02:24:22,235
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

1504
02:24:22,236 --> 02:24:25,614
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about, man!

1505
02:24:37,710 --> 02:24:41,087
This is Group Leader. We are entering the Flux Vortex.

1506
02:24:41,464 --> 02:24:43,257
Switch to manual flight mode.

1507
02:24:43,258 --> 02:24:45,050
Copy. Manual flight mode.

1508
02:25:19,960 --> 02:25:21,836
This is Papa Dragon.

1509
02:25:21,921 --> 02:25:25,006
I want this mission high and tight. I want to be home for dinner.

1510
02:25:32,515 --> 02:25:33,989
Suit Team, go.

1511
02:25:33,990 --> 02:25:36,267
All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

1512
02:25:46,821 --> 02:25:48,446
Move, move, move!

1513
02:25:54,078 --> 02:25:55,870
Bravo 1-1, move left.

1514
02:25:56,414 --> 02:25:59,833
Bravo 1-1 moving left. Watch flank.

1515
02:26:02,169 --> 02:26:05,797
- Watch formation. Keep moving.  - Roger that.

1516
02:26:05,798 --> 02:26:08,216
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.

1517
02:26:08,300 --> 02:26:09,676
Copy that. Over.

1518
02:26:09,677 --> 02:26:14,389
Eyes up. Check that overhead. And watch those thermal scans.

1519
02:26:14,974 --> 02:26:17,546
All call signs, Papa has lead,

1520
02:26:17,547 --> 02:26:18,351
pushing to target.

1521
02:26:18,352 --> 02:26:20,812
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.

1522
02:26:25,901 --> 02:26:28,445
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1523
02:26:29,405 --> 02:26:32,031
Gun crews, keep your head on a swivel.

1524
02:26:32,158 --> 02:26:35,076
Make no mistake, people, they're out there.

1525
02:26:36,662 --> 02:26:39,914
All right, people, target in sight. Range, four klicks.

1526
02:26:39,999 --> 02:26:42,208
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

1527
02:26:42,334 --> 02:26:43,698
Copy. Prepare to offload.

1528
02:26:43,699 --> 02:26:44,836
Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

1529
02:26:45,629 --> 02:26:47,839
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

1530
02:26:50,092 --> 02:26:51,176
Hold!

1531
02:26:59,185 --> 02:27:01,227
Charlie 2-1, got big movement.

1532
02:27:01,312 --> 02:27:02,729
- Hold position. - Hold up, hold up.

1533
02:27:02,813 --> 02:27:04,898
We got movement out there, 500 meters.

1534
02:27:04,899 --> 02:27:06,983
Charlie 2-1, hold position.

1535
02:27:13,073 --> 02:27:16,075
Sir, ground has movement! Fast approaching.

1536
02:27:16,076 --> 02:27:18,661
- Charlie Oscar, Rider section. - Firing line!

1537
02:27:19,038 --> 02:27:21,748
Targets closing. Range, 400 meters.

1538
02:27:22,458 --> 02:27:23,742
Can't you clean it up?

1539
02:27:23,743 --> 02:27:25,210
No, sir. It's the Flux.

1540
02:27:53,489 --> 02:27:56,157
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole. You follow me through.

1541
02:28:37,908 --> 02:28:40,660
All aircraft, weapons free! Weapons free!

1542
02:28:41,787 --> 02:28:42,996
Break right. Come around.

1543
02:28:46,542 --> 02:28:48,042
Light them up!

1544
02:28:55,676 --> 02:28:57,886
Break formation, engage all hostiles.

1545
02:29:05,144 --> 02:29:07,020
Yeah! Get some!

1546
02:29:46,018 --> 02:29:47,852
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1547
02:29:58,697 --> 02:30:00,490
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1548
02:30:01,158 --> 02:30:03,868
We're falling back! We're getting hammered!

1549
02:30:03,869 --> 02:30:04,869
Copy. Get out of there.

1550
02:30:10,042 --> 02:30:11,459
That's him. Get after him!

1551
02:30:28,394 --> 02:30:29,894
Take him out!

1552
02:30:38,195 --> 02:30:39,654
Light her up!

1553
02:30:48,664 --> 02:30:50,081
Right there!

1554
02:30:50,207 --> 02:30:52,458
You're not the only one with a gun, bitch.

1555
02:30:52,710 --> 02:30:54,419
- Keep her in your sights. - Purging. Feeding the leak.

1556
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:55,503
Arming all pods.

1557
02:31:01,218 --> 02:31:02,301
That's it!

1558
02:31:32,958 --> 02:31:34,083
Seyzey!

1559
02:32:38,023 --> 02:32:40,191
Rogue One is hit. I'm going in.

1560
02:32:41,151 --> 02:32:42,568
Sorry, Jake.

1561
02:32:59,586 --> 02:33:00,670
Fire.

1562
02:33:18,772 --> 02:33:21,274
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

1563
02:33:24,111 --> 02:33:25,778
Rogue One, you copy?

1564
02:33:27,781 --> 02:33:28,948
Trudy!

1565
02:33:39,835 --> 02:33:41,127
Time to target, two minutes.

1566
02:33:41,461 --> 02:33:43,880
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

1567
02:33:43,964 --> 02:33:46,132
Copy, Dragon. We are starting our bomb run.

1568
02:33:51,972 --> 02:33:54,037
Arm number one!

1569
02:33:54,038 --> 02:33:55,808
Number one armed!

1570
02:33:57,185 --> 02:33:58,436
Ma Jake!

1571
02:34:00,355 --> 02:34:01,522
I read you.

1572
02:34:10,657 --> 02:34:12,658
- Neytiri! - Seyzey's dead.

1573
02:34:13,243 --> 02:34:15,745
They are very close. They are many.

1574
02:34:17,164 --> 02:34:18,664
Do not attack.

1575
02:34:19,249 --> 02:34:21,208
Do you read me, Neytiri?

1576
02:34:23,795 --> 02:34:25,087
Do not attack!

1577
02:34:25,422 --> 02:34:28,591
Fall back now. Get out of there! That's an order!

1578
02:34:36,683 --> 02:34:37,892
Neytiri!

1579
02:34:39,978 --> 02:34:41,896
I got movement, I got movement.

1580
02:34:41,980 --> 02:34:44,231
Hold position. Something's coming.

1581
02:34:44,316 --> 02:34:46,108
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.Turn screens over.

1582
02:34:46,193 --> 02:34:47,849
We got movement 200 meters.

1583
02:34:47,850 --> 02:34:48,402
Hold your formation.

1584
02:34:48,403 --> 02:34:50,154
- Be ready. - Watch your flanks.

1585
02:34:55,285 --> 02:34:56,786
Hundred meters and closing fast.

1586
02:35:13,345 --> 02:35:14,929
We gotta get out of here!

1587
02:35:22,729 --> 02:35:24,438
- Fall back! Fall back! - Move! Move! Move!

1588
02:35:24,523 --> 02:35:26,941
Fall back! On the run! On the run!

1589
02:35:34,074 --> 02:35:36,742
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1590
02:35:43,667 --> 02:35:45,459
Eywa has heard you!

1591
02:35:56,013 --> 02:35:57,430
Come on!

1592
02:36:09,693 --> 02:36:11,569
Fall back! Move! Move!

1593
02:36:36,053 --> 02:36:38,763
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

1594
02:36:38,764 --> 02:36:42,892
Let's get this done. Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

1595
02:36:42,976 --> 02:36:45,895
- Press to target. - Copy. Pressing to target.

1596
02:36:45,896 --> 02:36:47,938
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1597
02:37:07,751 --> 02:37:10,252
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

1598
02:37:10,253 --> 02:37:12,588
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

1599
02:37:12,589 --> 02:37:13,005
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

1600
02:37:46,748 --> 02:37:47,915
Brace!

1601
02:38:04,933 --> 02:38:06,308
It's Sully.

1602
02:38:19,990 --> 02:38:22,283
- Mask on!  - Breach alarm!

1603
02:41:06,656 --> 02:41:08,532
Come on. Come to papa.

1604
02:41:35,977 --> 02:41:37,770
Give it up, Quaritch!

1605
02:41:40,815 --> 02:41:42,316
It's all over.

1606
02:41:43,568 --> 02:41:46,111
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

1607
02:41:46,112 --> 02:41:48,405
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1608
02:42:44,546 --> 02:42:45,796
Come on!

1609
02:43:01,646 --> 02:43:05,774
Hey, Sully, how's it feel to betray your own race?

1610
02:43:10,405 --> 02:43:12,614
You think you're one of them?

1611
02:43:13,825 --> 02:43:15,492
Time to wake up.

1612
02:44:59,681 --> 02:45:00,764
Jake?

1613
02:45:14,445 --> 02:45:15,570
Jake.

1614
02:45:33,548 --> 02:45:34,965
Jake.

1615
02:45:50,982 --> 02:45:52,983
Jake! Ma Jake!

1616
02:46:34,650 --> 02:46:35,984
I See you.

1617
02:46:41,574 --> 02:46:42,908
I See you.

1618
02:47:08,017 --> 02:47:09,226
I See you, Brother.

1619
02:47:10,436 --> 02:47:11,645
Are The People safe?

1620
02:47:14,482 --> 02:47:15,607
They're safe.

1621
02:47:22,115 --> 02:47:23,615
I can't...

1622
02:47:24,784 --> 02:47:27,035
I cannot lead The People.

1623
02:47:27,578 --> 02:47:29,913
You must lead them... Jakesully.

1624
02:47:31,290 --> 02:47:33,208
I'm not officer material.

1625
02:47:33,292 --> 02:47:35,043
It is decided.

1626
02:47:38,381 --> 02:47:39,589
Now...

1627
02:47:40,800 --> 02:47:43,218
...do the duty of Olo'eyktan.

1628
02:47:47,807 --> 02:47:49,474
I will not kill you.

1629
02:47:49,517 --> 02:47:51,143
It is the way!

1630
02:47:53,479 --> 02:47:55,063
And it is good.

1631
02:47:57,316 --> 02:47:59,151
I will be remembered.

1632
02:48:01,779 --> 02:48:05,824
I fought... with Toruk Macto!

1633
02:48:08,327 --> 02:48:10,203
And we were brothers.

1634
02:48:11,622 --> 02:48:15,709
And he... was my last shadow.

1635
02:49:02,131 --> 02:49:04,966
The aliens went back to their dying world.

1636
02:49:07,136 --> 02:49:10,055
Only a few were chosen to stay.

1637
02:49:22,276 --> 02:49:24,819
The time of great sorrow was ending.

1638
02:49:26,864 --> 02:49:29,282
Toruk Macto was no longerneeded.

1639
02:49:41,837 --> 02:49:45,715
Well, I guess this is my last video log.

1640
02:49:47,551 --> 02:49:51,388
'Cause whatever happens tonight, either way, I'm...

1641
02:49:52,390 --> 02:49:55,225
I'm not gonna be coming back to this place.

1642
02:49:58,854 --> 02:50:00,981
Well, I guess I'd better go.

1643
02:50:03,567 --> 02:50:06,611
Yeah, I don't want to be late for my own party.

1644
02:50:09,949 --> 02:50:12,409
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all.

1645
02:50:14,912 --> 02:50:17,247
This is Jake Sully signing off.
